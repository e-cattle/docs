The **e-Cattle** is a IoT platform to monitoring and automate production processes in beef cattle farms. Our conception is based in need for integrate multiple projects for precision livestock, such as:

* autonomous capture data using sensors;
* consumption, processing and use of data collected by software for decision making; and
* automation of rural property production processes based on the information obtained.

Thus, has been proposed a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) to create a platform with a communication protocol and a set of softwares to allow collect sensor data in field, organize them semantically, persist centrally and distribute to high-level decision-making applications.
